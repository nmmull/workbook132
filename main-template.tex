\chapter*{Preface}

The following is a collection of linear algebraic problems and
exercises for the course \texttt{CAS CS 132}: \textit{Geometric
  Algorithms} at Boston University.  As a student of this course, you
will hopefully work through nearly every problem in this document.
The problems are organized by topic and difficulty.  With regard to
difficulty there are four kinds of problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Exercises
\item True/False
\item More Difficult Problems
\item Challenge Problems
\end{itemize}
You should think of basic exercises as problems that are most like
problems that appear on quizzes, and the true/false and difficult
problems as those that are most like problems that appear on exams
(several of these problems and exercises have appeared on quizzes and
exams in the past).  The challenge problems are for those of who want
to think a bit harder, and are most like problems that may appear as
extra credit on exams.

Problems that require a computer or a calculator are labelled with the
symbol \faCalculator.  Otherwise, the expectation is that you should
be able to solve the problem by hand.

Solutions to these problems will never be made public, except during a
given semester when a problem is given in an assignment.  Also, during
the semester a student of the course is welcome to request a partial
solution any problem via our course public forum (usually Piazza).

Even if it's not explicitly stated, \textbf{you should always show
  your work and justify your answer for every problem.}  Happy
exercising/problem solving!

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item
  Find a solution to the linear system below with the following
  properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    the solution consists entirely of integer values;
  \item
    the values in the solution are relatively prime, i.e., it's not
    possible to divide the solution by a number to get another integer
    solution. So $(2, 4, 6)$ does not satisfy this property but $(1,
    2, 3)$ does.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Determine another general form solution which describes the same
    solution set, but for which $x_3$ is basic and $x_4$ is free.
  \item
    Determine an RREF which yields the general form solution from the
    previous part.
  \end{enumerate}
\item

  \textdollar 100,000.

    -8x_3 + 9x_4 &= x_2
  \end{align*}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Solve the first system of linear equations (in $x_1$ and $x_2$)
    and write down the augmented matrix of the second system with the
    solutions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ substituted in.
  \item
    Determine the augmented matrix of a \textit{single} system of
    linear equations \textit{with all four equations} in the variables
    $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$.  Describe the relationship between
    this matrix and the one in the previous part.
\end{enumerate}
\item
  Determine what must hold of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ so that the following
  linear system has exactly one solution.
  \begin{align*}
    ax + by &= 0 \\
    cx + dy &= 0
  \end{align*}
\item
  Determine an inconsistent linear system in 3 variables such that
  every pair of equations is consistent.  That is, give values for $a$
  through $l$ in the system
  \begin{align*}
    ax + by + cz &= d \\
    ex + fy + gz &= h \\
    ix + jy + kz &= l
  \end{align*}
  such that the system is inconsistent, but each pair of equations
  forms a consistent system.  Present your solution to each part as
  the an augmented matrix, i.e., of the form
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a & b & c & d \\
      e & f & g & h \\
      i & j & k & l
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{displaymath}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Achieve this with no more than 5 nonzero values for $a$ through
    $l$.
  \item
    Achieve this with all nonzero values for $a$ through $l$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Consider an arbitrary linear system in three variables:
  \begin{align*}
    ax + by + cz &= d \\
    ex + fy + gz &= h \\
    ix + jy + kz &= l
  \end{align*}
  Show that if $(s_x, s_y, s_z)$ and $(t_x, t_y, t_z)$ are solutions
  to the above system, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \left(
    \frac{s_x + t_x}{2},
    \frac{s_y + t_y}{2},
    \frac{s_z + t_z}{2}
    \right)
  \end{displaymath}
  is also a solution.  Describe why $(s_x, s_y, s_z) \not = (t_x, t_y,
  t_z)$ implies the system has infinitely many solutions.
\item
  One way to describe a line in 3 dimensions is to use a parameter
  $t$.  That is, after fixing values $a_x$, $b_x$, $a_y$, $b_y$,
  $a_z$, and $b_z$, a line can be described as all points of the form
  \begin{displaymath}
    (a_xt + b_x, a_yt + b_y, a_zt + b_z)
  \end{displaymath}
  for any real value of $t$.  Give a pair of 3 dimensional linear
  equations (each of which represents a plane in $\R^3$) whose
  intersection is exactly the line whose points are defined by the
  above parametric form.  \textit{Hint:} The line above can be thought
  of as a system in the variables $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$, e.g., one of
  its equations is $x - a_xt = b_x$. Write $t$ in terms of $x$ and
  substitute this value for $t$ into the other equations.
\item
  There are several ways to define row equivalence.  For example,
  suppose we restrict the replacement rule to only allow operations of
  the form
  \begin{displaymath}
    R_i \gets R_i + R_j
  \end{displaymath}
  That is, we can only add one row to another, without doing any
  scaling of that row.  We call this an \textit{addition operation}.

  Demonstrate that two matrices $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent if
  there is a sequence of addition and scaling operations which
  transform $A$ to $B$.  In particular, addition and scaling
  operations can simulate replacement and exchange operations.
